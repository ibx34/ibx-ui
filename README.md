# ibx-ui

A custom UI library for my projects, namely [ChannelCi](https://github.com/NellisLabs).

## TODO

- [ ] Select a nice, strong color theme. This may fall under branding for the organization that will primarily use this.
- [ ] Use consistant variables across all styles. Same colors, paddings, radiuses, etc.

## Contributing

Any contributations are appreciated. Im new to making UIs and React libraries so any help is appreciated.
